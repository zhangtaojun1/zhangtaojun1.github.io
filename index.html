Biography
I am an assistant professor at The University of Hong Kong, where I direct the Medical AI Lab. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare. We are dedicated to designing advanced machine learning algorithms for biomedical data analysis, primarily focusing on medical images, to improve medical decision-making. Specifically, we focus on: 1) developing multimodal learning algorithms (e.g., multimodal foundation model) to integrate multi-scale biomedical data for disease prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment design; 2) building real-world learning systems to learn generalizable, trustworthy, and fair representations from imperfect medical data; and 3) developing causality-driven learning algorithms to improve their interpretability and safety for healthcare problems.

Before joining HKU, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University, working with Prof. Lei Xing. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in CSE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2019 and the B.Eng degree in CS, Zhejiang University in 2015.

[New in Dec 2023] We have Postdoc/RA openings in multimodal learning and computational pathology. Please contact me if you are interested in this opportunity (Details).

We are looking for self-motivated Postdoc/PhD/RA/Interns, who are interested in medical AI, multimodal learning, computational pathology, and biomedical informatics. Welcome to drop me an email with your CV and transcripts. You can also apply for HKU Summer Research Programme 2024.
